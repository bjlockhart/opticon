Problem Statement

---
Contraband explicit digital files, specifically featuring underage minors, are proliferating on the internet and social media and cloud storage sites, such as twitter, tumblr and dropbox, google plus, etc. Current efforts have been incompletely effective in curbing the storage and distribution of these files. The shortcomings of the current approach using file hashing are effective in skirting privacy violation for users but will only function by matching previously known files through exact file hash matching. New contraband and older altered files will evade these current systems.  

Proposed Solution

---
Artifical intelligence using deep learning models and computer vision programs have come of age and are rapidly increasing in effective pattern matching. By levering these new technologies ability to learn and apply adaptive criteria, it is feasible that an A.I. could understand the definition of illegal imagery using systemic factors that would allow for detection of new, previously undiscovered material and as well increased sensitivity to previously identified files.
